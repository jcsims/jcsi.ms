## `deebn`
The result of my thesis work, `deebn` is a Clojure library that
implements Deep Belief Networks, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and
Deep Neural Networks. It's open source, licensed under the Eclipse
Public License, and available on
[Github](https://github.com/jcsims/deebn).

## Quality Clojure
Quality Clojure sprang out of the 2014
[Clojure Cup](https://clojurecup.com/#/), where Scott Bauer and I came
up with the original idea, and got as far as a design document and a
mockup. Source and current work on the project can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/quality-clojure/qualityclj).

## `cljagents`

`cljagents` is a small library I wrote in the course of working with
the [Quagents](http://www.cs.rochester.edu/trac/quagents) AI engine
from the University of Rochester. Source is available on
[Github](https://github.com/jcsims/cljagents).
