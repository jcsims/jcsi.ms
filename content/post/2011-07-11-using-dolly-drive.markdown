I just started my backup to [Dolly Drive][1].  I decided that I really should follow the best practices of backup and have a bootable solution as well as an off-site backup.  I get a bit paranoid that my pictures are only stored on an external drive (although at least it's a bit redundant, with a mirrored RAID setup), and would prefer it to be off-site as well.  Dolly Drive is surprisingly cheap, at only $7.50 a month for 100 GB and a current promotion (MACDD2011) that gives you 15% off.  They also add 5GB a month of free storage while you remain a customer, which I'm looking forward to.
