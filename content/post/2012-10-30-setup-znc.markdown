I recently made use of a Late 2009 Mac Mini (MacMini3,1) as a small server machine, and 
decided to use it as an IRC bouncer, among other things. Here’s what I did to get ZNC set 
up and running:

## Install znc

    sudo apt-get install znc

## Set up the znc user

I did this so that a non-privileged system user would be running znc, as it doesn’t 
need root privileges.

    sudo adduser --system --home /var/lib/znc --group znc

This should create the directory `/var/lib/znc`.

## Configure znc

Next is to configure znc using the `znc` user:

    sudo -u znc /usr/bin/znc --datadir=/var/lib/znc --makeconf

This will guide you through the initial options.  This would be a good time to test 
your znc install and config, to rule out any possible issues at this stage.

## Create the upstart script

I used an [upstart][1] script to make sure that znc was started at boot. I created 
the file at `/etc/init/znc.conf` with the following contents:

    # znc - IRC Bouncer

    description "IRC Bouncer"

    start on runlevel [2345]

    stop on runlevel [016]

    respawn
    respawn limit 15 5

    script
      exec sudo -u znc /usr/bin/znc --datadir=/var/lib/znc
    end script

This ensures that it’s running at all levels considered “running”, and shutdowns 
when the system is halting.  The `respawn` line attempts to respawn the process
if it exits incorrectly, and the limit ensures that the respawn doesn't get out
of hand if there's an issue.

At this point, you should be able to start znc if it’s not already running:

    sudo start znc
