I write Clojure at Staples SparX. My attention tends to gravitate
towards distributed systems and what makes them work.

# Work

In August of 2013, I completed my third internship at
[Charles River Analytics](https://www.cra.com/). I started and
completed a prototype written in Java, utilizing XML, RDF, OWL, OWL-S,
SOAP, ReST, and the Hadoop library.

In August of 2012, I completed my second internship at
[The Search Agency](http://www.thesearchagency.com/) in East
Greenwich, RI.  I worked with a team of two other interns on an
internal project to load, validate, and view tabular data. Both the
front end and server code were writtne in Java, using the GWT
framework to build the single page application.

In June of 2011, I completed a 3-month internship for Logitech at
their Camas site. I worked on an internal product used to test
speakers to obtain subjective test results. I wrote code in C# and
C++, and used the .NET Framework, DirectShow APIs, and Silverlight.

# Personal

I tend to enjoy most anything outdoors, especially when I can take my
wife and dogs with me.
